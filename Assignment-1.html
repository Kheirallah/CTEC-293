         <li>If a doctype is not specified the webpage may be rendered in older versions of HTML which may not support the elements used within your code. For example, HTML5 tags such as footer may not function. The difference between quirks mode and standards mode is 
         that quirks mode is used to render old-school webpages while standards mode renders webpages in modern form (Exact differences depend on the browser as they vary).
