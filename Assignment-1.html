         <li>If a doctype is not specified the webpage may be rendered in older versions of HTML which may not support the elements used within your code. For example, HTML5 tags such as footer may not function. The difference between quirks mode and standards mode is 
         that quirks mode is used to render old-school webpages while standards mode renders webpages in modern form (Exact differences depend on the browser as they vary). 
               <ul>
               <li>HTML 4.01 (Strict) doctype: &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"></li>
               <li>HTML5 doctype: &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML></li>
               <li>XHTML doctype: &lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd"></li>
               </ul>
         </li>
         <li>All of these browsers support just about all versions of HTML except for versions of Internet Explorer 8 & below which have issues with identifying HTML5 elements.</li>
         <li>A content management system is a application that allows for the creation or modification of digital content using a simple interface. Some of the most popular CMSs include: 
         WordPress, Drupal, and TextPattern. There are many advantages and disadvantages to each of these. WordPress is free to use but some features require a paid subscription. Drupal 
         is a complete CMS with plenty of features but is not free to use. TextPattern is a minimal CMS that is completely free to use. Minimal style CMSs such as TextPattern can use more
         features using plugins, however functionality in general is not as vast as paid services such as Drupal. Depending on the requirements of a webpage, a user must decide whether they
         need all of the features that a CMS provides when considering which CMS to use for their webpage.</li>
